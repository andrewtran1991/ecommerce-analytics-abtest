## 📚 Key Concepts Integration

### 1. Marketing & Behavioral Foundations

#### Marketing Funnel Theory
- **Awareness → Interest → Consideration → Purchase**
- Map customer touchpoints to funnel stages
- Analyze conversion rates at each stage
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities

#### Touchpoint Effect Hypothesis
- **Repeated exposures build trust, recall, and engagement**
- Test for diminishing returns (too many touches hurt)
- Analyze optimal touchpoint frequency and timing
- Consider behavioral economics principles (nudging, recency effects)

#### Behavioral Economics Applications
- **Nudging**: Use psychological triggers to influence behavior
- **Recency Effect**: Recent interactions have stronger impact
- **Overexposure Fatigue**: Too many touches can backfire
- **Social Proof**: Leverage peer behavior to influence decisions

### 2. Data Concepts & Feature Engineering

#### Core Variables
- **Outcome Variable**: Conversion (binary: 0/1)
- **Treatment Variable**: Number of touches (continuous)
- **Touch Types**: Email, call, notification, retargeting
- **Controls**: Demographics, lead source, seasonality, campaign type

#### Advanced Features
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Timing between touches, order effects
- **Customer Segments**: RFM analysis, behavioral clusters
- **Product Features**: Category, price, rating, popularity
- **Contextual Features**: Seasonality, day of week, time of day

### 3. Causal Inference Methods

#### Endogeneity Issues
- **Problem**: Leads that get more touches might already be "hot leads"
- **Solution**: Use causal inference methods to identify true causal effects

#### Methods to Address Endogeneity

**Fixed-Effects Regression**
```python
# Control for lead- and time-invariant factors
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols
model = ols('conversion ~ touches + C(user_id) + C(time_period)', data=df).fit()
```

**Propensity Score Matching**
```python
# Balance treated vs. untreated groups
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors

# Estimate propensity scores
ps_model = LogisticRegression()
ps_model.fit(X, treatment)
propensity_scores = ps_model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]

# Match treated and control units
nn = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=1)
nn.fit(propensity_scores.reshape(-1, 1))
```

**Instrumental Variables**
```python
# Use exogenous rules that dictate touches
from statsmodels.sandbox.regression.gmm import IV2SLS
model = IV2SLS(dependent, exog, endog, instrument).fit()
```

#### Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE)
- **Different segments respond differently to touches**
- **New vs. old customers**: Different sensitivity to touch frequency
- **Small vs. large businesses**: Different optimal touch strategies
- **High vs. low value customers**: Different touch cost-benefit ratios

### 4. Machine Learning & Prediction

#### Baseline Models
- **Logistic Regression**: Interpretable baseline for conversion prediction
- **Linear Regression**: For continuous outcomes (AOV, CLV)

#### Nonlinear Models
- **Gradient Boosting** (XGBoost, LightGBM): Capture complex interactions
- **Random Forest**: Handle non-linear relationships
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning for complex patterns

#### Personalization Models
- **Segment-Specific Models**: Different models for different customer types
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Use similar customers' behavior
- **Matrix Factorization**: Decompose customer-product interactions

#### Sequence Modeling
- **RNNs/LSTMs**: Model customer journey sequences
- **Transformers**: Attention-based sequence modeling
- **Markov Chains**: Simple sequence modeling for touchpoint transitions

### 5. Evaluation & Business Relevance

#### Conversion Metrics
- **Probability Uplift**: Increase in conversion probability
- **Actual Conversion Rates**: Observed conversion improvements
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical significance of results

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis
- **Touch Cost**: Cost per touchpoint (email, call, ad)
- **Conversion Value**: Revenue from converted customers
- **ROI Calculation**: (Conversion Value - Touch Cost) / Touch Cost

#### Optimal Policy Framework
- **Find Optimal Touch Count**: Sweet spot for maximum profit
- **Business Rules**: 
  - "Stop after 5 touches if no response"
  - "Emails effective early, calls matter later"
  - "Personalize touch frequency by customer segment"
